# Predicting the Likelihood of Heart Disease

**Introduction:**
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for 31% of all global deaths, and four out of five CVD-related fatalities are due to heart attacks or strokes. Patients with known CVD or those at higher risk due to preexisting factors, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension, would greatly benefit from an early detection system for heart failure. This project utilizes a dataset compiled from five large-scale studies, identifying 11 common features associated with CVD. The primary objective is to construct and train a machine learning model for identifying patients at an elevated risk of heart failure. Once implemented, this model could serve as a tool to assess the likelihood of heart failure in patients based on readily available and observable information.

**Project Overview:**

- **Problem Statement:** Developing a predictive model for early detection of heart failure in patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases.

- **Dataset:** The dataset is a combination of data from five significant studies, containing 11 common features associated with CVD.

- **Goal:** The main goal of this project is to build and train a machine learning model that can identify patients at an increased risk of heart failure.

**Why This Matters:**

- Early Detection: Identifying patients at risk of heart failure at an early stage can lead to timely intervention and potentially life-saving treatments.

- Precision Medicine: Tailoring medical care based on individual risk factors can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

- Public Health Impact: Reducing the burden of heart disease on healthcare systems and society as a whole.

**Project Implementation:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gaining insights into the dataset through data visualization and statistical analysis.

3. **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for building the predictive model.

4. **Model Building:** Developing and training machine learning models for predicting heart failure risk.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and techniques.

**Model Summary:**

The data modeling process commenced with the creation of a foundational baseline using a dummy classifier for swift evaluation. Metrics such as ROC AUC, a classification report, and a confusion matrix were employed for assessment. Subsequently, four models—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—were carefully implemented.

A consistent methodology, involving individual pipelines, grid/random search cross-validation, and model-specific adaptations, was applied to each. The Logistic Regression model emerged as the prime contender, exhibiting superior performance in Precision, Recall, and Accuracy. Given the medical context's emphasis on minimizing false negatives, the Logistic Regression model's remarkable 91.43% recall rate elevated its significance.

**Recommendations for Future Model Enhancements**

In future analyses, augmenting patient data by including factors like height, weight, and pre-existing heart conditions is advisable. These additional attributes can significantly enhance the model's predictive capabilities, providing a more thorough assessment of an individual's risk for heart failure. Incorporating such information will broaden the spectrum of patient characteristics, refining predictions and enhancing accuracy.

To further elevate model performance, exploring advanced machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, is warranted. Neural networks have shown prowess in complex pattern recognition tasks, offering potential for improved scoring metrics and uncovering subtle data relationships.

Additionally, for practical application, consideration should be given to developing a user-friendly interface. This interface would facilitate seamless deployment in real-world healthcare settings, allowing healthcare professionals to input patient data, obtain risk assessments, and make informed clinical decisions effortlessly. This user-centric approach aims to streamline model integration into the healthcare workflow for the benefit of both patients and healthcare providers.
